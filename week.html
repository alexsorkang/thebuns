        Our top contenders for POW this week were Bunicus with his double knife kill and MapleBun with his last round smoke defuse. 
        <br><br>
        While Bunicus certainly impressed with his back-to-back knife kills in a single round (as well as an additional knife kill earlier in the game), what must be taken into account is the impact these kills had on the game. Unfortunately, that is where his candidacy for POW falls short. Our team was already winning by a large margin, and in the round in question, he had the assistance of his teammates who were distracting the enemy. Not to mention most of the team was still alive at the end of the round. 
        <br><br>
        With that said, MapleBun's play took place in the final round of the game with a 14-15 scoreline and in a 1v1 situation. With his team watching on anxiously, MapleBun threw down a smoke and began to defuse the bomb in the face of the enemy. In perhaps the most nerve-wracking moment of the week, he succesfully defused the bomb while taking fire under a rain of bullets. His quick thinking made the difference between a tie and a loss, and it is for that reason that the Player of the Week must go to... 
        <br><br>
        MapleBun! (otherwise known as Kiru) 
        <br><br>
        Well Bun, Kiru! Congratulations on receiving this honor. May you wear this distinction proudly.
      </h3>
