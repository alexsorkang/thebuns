      <h3>Just a week ago, our clan was dying and the few members we had were going stale. But thanks to our new members, our yeast rises once again. Now we starch onwards to a new age. An exciting, bun-filled age. The Age of Bun. 
      <br><br> 
      We will continue to grow, in name and in calories. We will add to our number, bun a time. Matchmaking is not ready for us; they are bunprepared. We will overwhelm them with our greatness, with our exquisite texture and pleasant taste. And we will not stop. Not until all of the crumbs we have left behind tell of the legend of the almighty M4aBun. We will not be consumed. We will be Number Bun. 
      <br><br>
      To our new members, welcome. We are glad to have you. We hope that you will have a bunderful time with us, and we look forward to playing with you. 

      And as always.... Good Luck, and Have Bun.</h3>
    <h3 class="righteo">...Coming Soon</h3>
